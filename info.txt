[NAME:Ferrets - Hunting & War]
[DESCRIPTION:This adds ferrets into the game as a domesticated and trainable pet, and also their non-domesticated relatives, polecats.]
[STEAM_CHANGELOG:Small tweaks to creature art that was bothering me so much I couldn't play, but probably insignificant to most users. Image file format and export options optimised to better match vanilla.]
